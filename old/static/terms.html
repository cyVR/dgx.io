The auditor and auditee creates an encrypted messaging connection between each other over some neutral communication channel. The auditee connects to the website as normal and logs in, and then browses to the specific page that proves the required information. Then the auditor and auditee use their encrypted connection to negotiate secrets for the SSL/TLS session such that the auditor can find out what is on the page that the auditee loads, without gaining control of the connection or seeing the auditee's login details. More information can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://tlsnotary.org/" target="_blank">https://tlsnotary.org/</a></p>
